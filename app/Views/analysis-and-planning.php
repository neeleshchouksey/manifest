            <h3>Analyze and Planning</h3>
            <br />
            <p class="justify process_prg">Website analysis in the web development lifecycle is, really, the very first phase of the process.
              This is where the web developers take the requirements you bring them by answering the 5 key questions: <br/>
            <ul class="bullet_process check_right check_ic span">
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Why do you need a website?</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Who is your target audience?</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>What will the website do for you?</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Where will you host the website?</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>When do you want the project finished?</li>
            </ul>
           
            <p class="justify process_prg"> The answers to each of these questions helps the web developer build the foundation of the analysis. It is the puzzle pieces to help
              build the specifications and outline of the project. From these answers the web developer will slowly piece together the puzzle, 
              tossing out pieces that don't fit or adding in new ones when required. </p>
            <p class="justify process_prg"> Even after answering the 5 questions you can expect many more. The web developer takes the answers and refines them by asking more. 
              The answers help establish precise details as to: </p>
            <ul class="bullet_process check_right check_ic span">
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Who the target audience is</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>How the website will improve the business</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Usability</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>What the website is meant to do</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Website Usability</h3><br />
            <p class="justify process_prg">Defining usability needs accounts for 75% of the final analysis. What good is a website 
              that nobody wants to navigate, read, purchase from, use, or suggest to their friends? Many of the questions asked during 
              the website development lifecycle analysis revolve around usability. </p>
            
            <p class="justify process_prg">From a programming standpoint coding an email contact form is a bunch of letters and syntax. 
              If the visitor saw the results of the unrefined code they would likely find the visual form unprofessional and boring. 
              If it isn't important they will find something else to do then use the form. </p>
            <br />
            <ul class="bullet_process check_ic">
              <li>25% of the analysis is the requirements of the contact form - what it needs to do.</li>
              <li>75% of the analysis is visually creating it so people want to use it.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="justify process_prg">Website usability is beyond the scope of this article, but I hope you can see how it is fundamental to 
              the analysis phase. The analysis is the beautiful Ikea table you bought. It is clearly defined as the final outcome of the project.
              You know what it is, what it is meant to do, how it best fits in your current workflow and whether you want to use it from the very 
              first glance. </p>
